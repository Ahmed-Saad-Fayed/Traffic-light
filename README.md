# 🚦 Arduino Traffic Light Project

A simple Arduino-based project that simulates a **traffic light system** with user interaction via push buttons and numeric output on a **7-segment display**.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic **digital I/O control** using an **Arduino Nano**, suitable for beginners learning:

- 🔢 How to control a **7-segment display**
- 🔘 How to use **push buttons** for user interaction
- 💡 How to manage **multiple outputs (LEDs)**

### 🔧 Key Features

- 🟢🟡🔴 LED traffic light simulation (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- 🧮 Displays numbers on a **7-segment display**  
- 🎮 Two push buttons for manual control  
- 🔌 Built on a **breadboard** for easy prototyping

---

## 🧰 Components Used

- 1x **Arduino Nano**  
- 1x **7-segment display**  
- 6x **LEDs** (2 sets of Red, Yellow, Green)  
- 2x **Push buttons**  
- 6x **Resistors** (220Ω – 330Ω recommended)  
- 1x **Breadboard**  
- Jumper wires
