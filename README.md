# 🚦 Arduino Traffic light  Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a simple Arduino-based control system featuring:

A 7-segment display to show numbers.

LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) for indicating states or signals.

Two push buttons for input control 

Built on a breadboard with an Arduino Nano.

The setup demonstrates basic digital I/O control, suitable for learning:

How to control a 7-segment display.

How to use buttons for user interaction.

How to manage multiple outputs (LEDs).

## 🧰 Components Used
1x Arduino Nano

1x 7-segment display 

6x LEDs (2 sets of red, yellow, green)

2x Push buttons

6x Resistors for LEDs (220Ω – 330Ω recommended)

Breadboard & Jumper wires

## ⚙️ How it Works
Buttons: Used to trigger events

LEDs: Indicate certain statuses or modes 

7-Segment Display: Shows numeric values.
